# WHO-ICD-10

This repository contains some XSL example to parse the ICD-10 tabular.xml version, transforming the results in a CSV format.

Catalog syncrhonizing or specific data extraction of a XML using XSL, with or without templates, can help the organizations to reduce IT maintenance time.

To use the templates you need to download the ICD-10 XML. Maybe from the CDC site:
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd10cm.htm

or the ftp site: 

ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Publications/ICD10CM/2017/

To apply the xsl to the xml you can use any xml processor available in the market, or compile the Delphi program "StyleView" to create an application which allow you to do the task.

"History of ICD

The first international classification edition, known as the International List of Causes of Death, was adopted by the International Statistical Institute in 1893. 

WHO was entrusted with the ICD at its creation in 1948 and published the 6th version, ICD-6, that incorporated morbidity for the first time. The WHO Nomenclature Regulations, adopted in 1967, stipulated that Member States use the most current ICD revision for mortality and morbidity statistics. The ICD has been revised and published in a series of editions to reflect advances in health and medical science over time. 

ICD-10 was endorsed in May 1990 by the Forty-third World Health Assembly. It is cited in more than 20,000 scientific articles and used by more than 100 countries around the world."
